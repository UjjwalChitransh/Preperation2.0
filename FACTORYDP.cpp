//In the main function, a CircleFactory is instantiated through a ShapeFactory pointer. Then, a Circle is created using the createShape method of the factory. The client code doesn't need to know the specific class of the created object; it relies on the abstract interfaces provided by the factory and the product (polymorphism).
//This pattern allows for easy extension by adding new shapes or factories without modifying existing client code, promoting flexibility and maintainability in the codebase.


//In object-oriented programming (OOP), a concrete class is a class that implements the details of an abstract class or interface. It provides a complete implementation of all the methods and attributes defined in the abstract class or interface, making it instantiable and usable.
//In the context of the factory design pattern example, the concrete classes are Circle and Square. They implement the abstract Shape interface by providing specific implementations for drawing and calculating the area of circles and squares, respectively. These classes are instantiable, and their objects can be used to draw and calculate the area of their respective shapes.
//the Shape class serves as an abstract base class for all concrete shape classes
//By defining this abstract Shape class, the factory design pattern can create objects of different shapes without the client code needing to know the specific type of shape being created. The concrete shape factories handle the creation of the appropriate concrete shape objects based on the input type and parameter.

FACTORY DP EXTENSION:

Abstract Product (Shape):
This is an abstract class (or interface) that declares the interface for a type of product.

Concrete Products (Circle, Square): concrete implementations of the abstract product.


Abstract Factory (ShapeFactory): This is an interface or abstract class that declares the interface for creating the abstract products (in this case, Shape).


Concrete Factories (CircleFactory, SquareFactory):
These are concrete implementations of the abstract factory.


Client Code (Main Function): The client code uses the abstract factory to create instances of concrete products without knowing their specific classes. It relies on the abstract interfaces provided by the factory and the product.
